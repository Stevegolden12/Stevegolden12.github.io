			<p class="mainBlog__bodyText">I am still in basic stages of learning ReactJS this week.  Starting to get ReactDOM.render down pretty good but moving forward has been slow.  Maybe it was Fourth of July or all the concepts that come with ReactJS.  This is just a part of coding.  Those times when you are stuck and no matter how you see it there is no answer at that point of time.  I am grateful because one thing I have gotten from coding so far is the ability to deal with frustration much better.  I took a day off yesterday and did some other non-coding related things and came back to it today.  That helped me out a good deal.</p>
			<p class="mainBlog__bodyText mainBlog__topMargin">My initial frustration is gone because I know that I did learn some ReactJS. Failure is the best learning tool at times and this was no exception.  This week I did a lot of reading the ReactJS documentation which is amazing.  However I think I will need other types of learning so I have a few video tutorials I will watch.  Also some of these are demos so I will go step by step through it and build it.  I enjoy learning how to learn and I was watching a video this week about the best couple of ways to learn is actually demos, practicing it, and building stuff.  Not sure I am at building stuff point yet but I think demos and practicing will be my goals.</p>

        I have learned a decent amount of HTML, CSS, JavaScript.  I understand the basics and played with bootstrap.  Not my favorite thing BootStrap but I can see the quickness of building something in it.  Ironically I can also see the headaches of maintain it as well.  So I am to a point that I need to learn a JS framework.  The most difficult part was trying to figure out if I go React or Vue.  My feeling is that in a few years that Vue will probably pass React but at this time I feel that React will be the best possible jumping off point now.

        I have played around with it for the last few days and a couple of things have stand out.  I will get a MUCH better understanding of JavaScript because React really seems to utilize a lot of JS is.  For me it is confusing because I am still trying to grasp the benefits of React. Coming from building pages from scratch.  I wonder why I need React so much but I know that in huge sites compartmentalization will help.  Also there seems to have programming functionality in HTML so that is interesting too.  All in all it should be very eye opening.
      </p>
				<p class="mainBlog__bodyText mainBlog__topMargin">
        Right now I am trying to find the right tutorials and instruction in learning React.  FreeCodeCamp is too vague but I will be using it as a secondary learning tool.  PluralSight has been disappointing.  It is the video tutorials but like 1 to 3 years old and do not seem like they are using all the new features and there is no uniformity in the video courses.  I am going to check some other places out.  I heard great things about Udacity but they are super expensive.

				<p class="mainBlog__bodyText">This is my first blog post.  I have talked about it for a while now and there are many things that are uncertain about blogging.  I don’t know if I will be any good at it.  I am not sure if I am doing this for the right reasons.  I don’t know if I have enough knowledge to impart that can help people when it comes to web development yet.  However, I am certain about one thing:  I do not want to stay still on this nor my learning when it comes to web development.  This is my first step on some journey and hopefully you can glean something meaningful for yourself.</p>
